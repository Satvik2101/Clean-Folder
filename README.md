# Clean-Folder
Cleans up your messy folders(especially folders like Downloads) and sorts out files extension-wise. Doesn't harm existing folders. Requires PYTHON 3

Put it in the folder which is to be cleaned and run once. 
Make sure all files in the specified folder are closed or else the program won't be able to copy them and you will get an error.
NOTE: -- If you don't have permission to move a particular file or 2 files with same name, one will probably get deleted. 
V2 fixes some bugs.
